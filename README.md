GMiner was created by a Russian group of specialists in the field of high performance computing and cryptography.
The first version of GMiner was released on September 21, 2018 and was received quite warmly among users.
Thanks to its unique developments and stability, in just six months, the miner became a favorite on the Equihash algorithms.
The miner is focused on NVIDIA and AMD platforms and supports most popular algorithms such as: Ethash, ProgPoW, KAWPOW, Equihash, CuckooCycle.


Improved LHR performance, added two modes (–lhr_mode): 0 – energy save mode, 1 – maximal performance mode (default).
Miner display LHR unlock percentage in statistics table (LHR row), you can adjust it by –lhr_tune option.
Now –lhr_tune meaning GPU unlock percentage, for compatibility lhr tunes below 10 mapped to new default values.
If LHR auto-tune (–lhr_autotune) enabled miner tries increase LHR unlock percentage while mining.
Improved RavenCoin performance, fixed floating hashrate
Display maximum difficulty of shares for each GPU
